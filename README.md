In order to use Frisbeeh app you need to sign up creating your own credentials or login with existing credentials. User credential verification is done through Google Firebase email/password authentication method. Frisbeeh stores and collects the data inputted by the user in Firebase database. 

If you wish to test Frisbeeh without creating your own account please use the test user -account I've created:
