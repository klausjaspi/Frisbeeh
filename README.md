Frisbeeh is an android platform application used to calculate and to view user scores in frisbeegolf sport. It's to create more simplified and efficient user interface to keep count of scores. This application is a project of mine, purpose was to practice my skills and also to build an application to represent my current skill set.
This project was made with Android Studio platform and java programming language.

In order to use Frisbeeh app you need to sign up creating your own credentials or login with existing credentials. User credential verification is done through Google Firebase email/password authentication method. Frisbeeh stores and collects the data inputted by the user in Firebase database. 

If you wish to test Frisbeeh without creating your own account please use the test user -account I've created:

Username: testuser@gmail.com
password: test123
nickname: testuser

Please keep in mind this is a student made project.

Thank you!
